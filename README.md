# CLOCK-JS

## Update History

### Date: March 24, 2024
**Time:** 12:05 am

I have been working on this clock for the past hour but missed my movie time with my mom. I will now go watch the movie and check back with you later.

**Time:** 9:59 am

I finished watching the movie "Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya." It was a pretty good movie with lots of funny and cringe moments. The film ended with "to be continued," so I am guessing there will be a part 2. If there is, please watch it.

**Time:** 12:02 pm

Finished the clock project. Don't worry, I wasn't fully focusing on this project as I was watching YouTube.

I updated the README file.
